            <h1>Ho-Oh</h1>
            <p>Ho-Oh has long been considered the chief deity of the Johto region. Considered a sacred and mythical creature with powers over life itself, it has been called the Bird of Heaven, the Life-Binder, the Phoenix King, the Guardian of the Sky, the Sacred Flame, and many others. It has been said that those who have seen Ho-Oh are destined for greatness, and its feathers are said to bring good luck.
            <br><br>
            Many ancient Johto legends have Ho-Oh as its focal point; one being that Ho-Oh came across barren land, scarred and broken. It asked its brother Lugia to bring good winds to bring pure rain to the lands. When asked what Ho-Oh would do, it responded by razing the land with its holy fire. Wherever the flames touched flowers and trees would grow. Soon Humans and Pokémon alike would move into the once dead land. And thus the nation of Johto was born.
            <br><br>
            A second legend has a blacksmith was praying for a creation that would make him famous. In response, Ho-Oh came and burned all the trees around the blacksmith's shop. The blacksmith asked why it did that, and Ho-Oh said that new trees would grow to replace the ones it had burned. On those trees would be a magical fruit, and the blacksmith was to use that fruit to forge hollow balls that would capture even the mightiest of beasts. The blacksmith did as Ho-Oh asked and became the greatest blacksmith in Johto. This legend is the mythical origin of the legendary Azalean Apricorn Ball crafters.
            <br><br>
            The third and most famous legend takes place, supposedly, 500 years ago in feudal Johto. An evil warlord wanted to take control of Ho-Oh for his own desires and sent his army to invade Ecruteak City's sacred Brass Tower to take it by force. The ensuing battle between the warlord's army and tower's guardians was so violent that the tower itself was burned to the ground. In an act of mercy, Ho-Oh resurrected three Pokémon that had died in the carnage as its earthly avatars, Raikou, Entei, and Suicune. Ho-Oh itself, disgusted with humanity's destructiveness, left the Brass Tower, forever flying the skies of the world in search of a trainer with a pure heart.
            <br><br>
            Every spring, the citizens of Ecruteak hold a massive week-long festival, praying for good harvest and fortune in the coming year and celebrating the end of winter with feasts, dances, and burning pyres in Ho-Oh's name. At the end of the festival, an offering of Apricorns is taken up to the top of the remaining Tin Tower. There an ancient dance is performed, in hopes that Ho-Oh will hear the music and finally return. </p>
