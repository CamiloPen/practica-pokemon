            <h1>Groudon</h1>
            <p>Groudon has long been worshipped by the inhabitants of Hoenn as the God of Flame and Earth, being diametrically opposed to Kyogre, God of the Sea, and subordinate to Rayquaza, God of the Sky. In most of Hoenn’s religious texts and creation myths, Groudon and its brothers fashioned the world from the primordial darkness of time and space, creating land for humans and Pokémon to dwell upon and fire so that man might be able to eat food without taking ill. In turn, Kyogre and Rayquaza blessed humanity with the gifts of the sea and all its bounty, and the sky, with which man and Pokémon might live, respectively.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the creature’s association with volcanoes has also translated into a belief that Groudon is a spirit of death and rebirth, much like the lava flows that, while deadly, inevitably increase the amount of arable land. The souls of the dead are carried along the pyroclastic flows of the underworld to Mt. Pyre, where they must learn penitence before they can return to the land of the living. Because of the immense spiritual importance of the mountain, a Blue Orb, fashioned eons ago by inhuman hands and tied to the Continent Pokémon’s power, rests atop Mt. Pyre’s summit.</p>
            <h2>Known Sightings</h2>
            <p>Groudon is an extremely rare species of Pokémon; in the last century, there has only been one sighting, when the creature was briefly roused from its slumber by the eco-terrorist organization known as Team Magma. Despite this, the Earthshaker appears in sculpture, cave paintings, statuary, and many other forms of art throughout Hoenn’s long history; this artistic evidence, when combined with fossilized bone and tissue fragments, show that the creature was indisputably real.
            <br><br>
            In the past few years, there has been at least one attempt by Magma splinter groups to resurrect a Groudon from a single fossil using technology pioneered by the scientists at Cinnabar Island; this attempt failed disastrously, and all working on the doomed project were killed in the resulting catastrophe. </p>
