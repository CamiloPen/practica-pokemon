            <h1>Unown</h1>
            <p>Several native Johtian myths discribe a powerful Creator emerging from the stars. When the Creator spoke, His speech became words. These words, according to His will, wrote the writings that form the world. All that existed was written down by the words. The sea, the land, and the sky. The story of every living being was written down. Finally, the stories complete, the Creator rested, and His words fell asleep, stored in sacred temples. They await the day that the Creator would speak once more. 
            <br><br>
            It is now believed that the Unown are the inspiration for this myth.</p>
            <h2>Known Sightings</h2>
            <p>The Ruins of Alph were one of the most mysterious archeological sights in all of Johto. Whatever ancient civilization built them is unknown. They seemingly had no purpose, being large empty buildings with carvings of various Pokemon. Including, strangely enough, Pokemon which had been long extinct by the time the buildings had been constructed. But strangest of all, were the writings covering the walls of the structures. The writings engraved into the walls were comprised of the modern Latin alphabet. This despite the fact that the Ruins of Alph predate any Latin speaking civilization, and are geographically separated to such an extent that any such crossover is impossible. Finally, the engravings were, as far as any linguist and archeologist could tell, gibberish.
            <br><br>
            Recently, answers to some of these questions have been answered. One of the smaller buildings excavated contained what appeared to be a sliding block puzzle embedded into the wall. Researchers did not manipulate it, due to fears of the mechanism being damaged. A young trainer, ignorant of how to handle such relics, entered the ruins during a time when security over such things was lax. The trainer solved the puzzle, and this activated some unknown trigger within the ruins. The engravings came to life, removing themselves from the walls and revealing themselves to be Pokemon. It is now believed that the Ruins of Alph exist as a sort of holding pen for the Unown. Why they are contained within these buildings, however, is still unknown.
            <br><br>
            Shortly afterwards, ruins in Sinnoh also became inhabited by Unown. Sightings have also occurred in the Sevii Islands. </p>
