            <h1>Moltres</h1>
            <p>
                Moltres has long been venerated by the inhabitants of Kanto and Johto as the Avatar of Flame, being superior to Articuno, Avatar of Frost and inferior to Zapdos, Avatar of Lightning. In this way, the three birds form a sacred Triad of Fire, Ice, and Lightning that preserves the equilibrium of the world; should their balance be disrupted, a great cataclysm would befall our world.
                <br><br>
                Moltres is seen as both a benefactor and a destroyer. When it is in balance with its siblings, its warmth dispels rain and cold, and its cleansing flames revitalize the soil in portent of the onset of spring; but when the balance is disrupted, droughts and heat waves bake the earth in its wake, and wildfires erupt from its wings to burn the land to ash. Moltres is known to be incredibly hot-blooded and quick to anger, yet in spite of this fearsome temperament, it often mediates disputes between its siblings, Articuno and Zapdos; because of this, Moltres is seen as a sign of peace, and homage is paid to the Avatar of Flame at the beginning of every Pokémon League Conference by runners carrying a torch — rumoured to have been ignited with one of Moltres’ own eternally-burning feathers as part of a pact with the creature— across the nation to light a pyre at the tournament’s location.

            <h2>Known Sightings</h2>
            <p>
                Of the three Legendary Birds, Moltres is the most willing to interact with humans on a regular basis. In the past it would make an appearance at the beginning of every annual Pokémon League Tournament, thereby signaling the beginning of the games, and a wreath made from the avian’s shed feathers would be gifted to the winner of each year’s final round in recognition of their skill as a Pokémon trainer. Apart from such public appearances, Moltres was known to roost atop the summit of Mt. Ember, although conflicting reports claim that it frequented the lower caverns of Kanto’s Victory Road at around the same period of time. Cinnabar Island's Blaine attests to a journey had in a freezing mountain range in which Moltres descended and rescued him when he became lost and nearly froze to death, supposedly inspiring him to take up the Fire-type out of gratitude.

                After the eruption of Cinnabar Volcano, Moltres departed from its roost and flew north to cooler climes; it could be seen in the vicinity of Johto’s famous peak, Mt. Silver, and has occasionally been observed on the wing in Sinnoh. It is believed to have been one of several Legendary Pokémon involved in the Cipher Incident in Orre several years ago; since then, it has kept to itself and has stopped appearing at the various Pokémon League Tournaments, to the worry and disappointment of Moltres watchers everywhere.

        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <p>
            Moltres’ body constantly emits palpable waves of heat, which intensify in direct proportion to the creature’s mood; as such, it is constantly burning moisture out of the air and making its immediate surroundings dry and arid, making it difficult for plants and animals to remain properly-hydrated in its presence. This heat, combined with the embers which shoot from its wings with each flap, often leads to the ignition of powerful fires that can burn a forest of mature redwoods to the ground in little more than a day. Notably, when Moltres is injured, it has been observed diving into the craters of active volcanoes and emerging from the magma a few minutes later, being in a healthier state when it emerges from its scalding “bath.”
            <br><br>
            Moltres is among the most powerful Fire-type Pokémon, rivaling Entei and Ho-Oh in terms of sheer destructive power. While it does not have the same range of pyrokinetic abilities as these two, the Avatar of Flame can spew a blazing stream of fire hot enough to reduce the landscape to molten slag, and it can expel scathing gouts of steam and rays of solar radiation from its beak. Moltres can flap its wings with enough force to generate blades of air or vortices of fire to slash and entrap a potential foe, and the heat it continuously generates is sufficient to dispel cloud cover and enhance the sun’s rays, increasing the potency of its own pyrokinetic attacks. Like Articuno and Zapdos, it displays some psionic ability, although it limits the use of its mental powers to increase its own agility and speed, relying on the toughness of its body and the all-consuming fury of its flames to attain victory over an enemy.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, Moltres appears to emit a strong presence of regal might, a trait it shares with its siblings. Simply put, Pokémon who are ordered to attack any member of the Legendary Birds will only do so reluctantly and with great difficulty, as though some sort of geass were compelling them not to lift so much as a finger against them.
