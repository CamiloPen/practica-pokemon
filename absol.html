            <h1>Absol</h1>
            <p>Absol (scientific name Panthera antecursor) is a leonine Pokémon with navy blue skin and shockingly white fur. Both sexes of this species possess a curious mane in the shape of a long beard, while the fur on the top of its head resembles a magatama, for reasons that evolutionary Pokébiologists can only guess at. Curiously, its feline face is devoid of fur, leaving its blue skin and red eyes exposed for all to see; a single horn, bearing an uncanny resemblance to a sickle, sprouts from the right temporal lobe. Absol’s legs each possess three talons and a pointed spur jutting from the rear of the tarsus or ulna, and its tail resembles the blade of a scythe </p>
            <h2>Notable Biology</h2>
            <p>As with most feline Pokémon, Absol possesses a refined, gyroscopic inner ear that allows it to reorient itself in midair and land on its feet, as well as excellent night vision. In addition, its horn is lined with a number of aerokinetic cells that allow it to stimulate air currents when swung. The species is also notable for its incredible longevity, with captive specimens documented as living for well over one hundred years.
            <br><br>
            Most impressive of all, however, is Absol’s tactile sense; fine enough to detect subtle shifts and eddies in the atmosphere or faint vibrations in the lithosphere from across the globe, Absol’s incredibly refined sense of touch allows it limited precognition regarding the onset of natural disasters. In the past, when the species was both more numerous and more altruistic, they would often run into towns or villages in large prides and attempt to warn the inhabitants of impending destruction; however, as they frequently arrived too late to prevent these disasters — and because of their somewhat threatening appearance and frequent attacks on livestock — the popular misconception that Absol actually cause natural disasters became widespread, and they were hunted nearly to extinction. Now Absol is considered a Critically Endangered species of Pokémon, and Trainers who successfully capture one are required to either turn them over to a Pokémon preserve, such as the Safari Zone, or fill out a small mountain of legal waivers signifying that they are not endangering the Absol or themselves by training it. </p>
