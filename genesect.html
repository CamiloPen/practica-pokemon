            <h1>Genesect</h1>
            <p>Much of what is known of Genesect comes from former members of its creator: Team Plasma, in particular a scientist named Dudley, who was a key player in the creation of the Pokémon. Though he is rarely seen nowadays, he has been known to frequently visit Team Plasma's abandoned P2 Laboratory complex.
            <br><br>
            Genesect started life as an unknown species of Bug-type Pokémon that dates all the way back to the Paleozoic period - specifically, 300 million years ago. Comparing Genesect's capabilities to those of contemporary predator Kabutops show that back then it was one of the strongest and most fierce hunters of the era. It has been theorised by historians that this Pokémon is the reason behind the mass extinction of several Pokémon who lived back then. How the Pokémon ultimately went extinct is unknown - though the relative scarcity of fossilised remains of it compared to those of other extinct Pokémon would seem to suggest that either the species was limited in number back then, or that what killed them was destructive enough to have annihilated a large majority.
            <br><br>
            300 million years later, a fossil of the Pokémon was discovered by the anti-Pokémon Trainer group, Team Plasma. Analysing the fossil and noticing the Pokémon's apparent power and mercilessness back then, it was decided that its capabilities would be enhanced further with modern technology, thus creating the most powerful Pokémon of all. And so began Project G - and the resulting Pokémon was to be codenamed "Genesect" (early documents suggest it was intitially codenamed "Genosect", but was hastily renamed after it was realised such a name would offend Team Plasma's king, N, by implying the Pokémon was made to be a weapon - "which it was, let's be honest here"). Within Team Plasma's secret laboratory (dubbed the "P2 Laboratory"), the Pokémon was revived by Team Plasma's scientists, led and supervised by Dudley, and was subsequentially subjected to a number of surgical procedures to enhance its capabilities, such as augmenting its muscles with powerful hydraulics, welding powerful steel armor onto its body and boosting its intelligence with brain implants and microcomputers.

            While a cannon (nicknamed the "Techno Buster") intended to be planted onto its back was being developed, N visited the laboratory to see how the project was going. According to a scientist present there, "Lord N saw Genesect, and he just... stared, as did it to him. His face was visibly shocked, disgusted even... I looked at the face we had given Genesect - a cold, murderous grin, meant to strike fear into the hearts of its enemies - and I felt that even if we hadn't given it that, it'd be grinning in delight all the same." N, who was of the belief that Pokémon were perfect beings who lost their natural beauty if modified by science, decreed that Project G was to be shut down, Genesect terminated and the "defiled" P2 Laboratory closed and abandoned. The scientists all complied with N's wishes, except for Dudley, who felt angered that N had denied his talents. He pretended to have killed Genesect to satisfy N, then later quit Team Plasma to finish Genesect in the lab independently. However, what happened to Genesect after this point is unknown, as Dudley refuses to tell anyone what happened next. What can be inferred, however, is that after Genesect's completion, the Pokémon disappeared without a trace</p>
